# **Privacy Policy**
_Last updated: December 2025_

Pocket Flow ("the App") is a personal budgeting and expense tracking application.  
We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This policy explains how the App collects, uses, and stores information.

---

## **1. Data Collection**
Pocket Flow stores all expense-related data **locally on your device**.  
The App does **not** collect, upload, or transmit any personal or financial data to external servers.

The following data may be stored locally if you choose to enter or import it:

- Expense amounts and categories  
- Dates and times  
- Notes  
- Imported files (e.g., CSV backups from other budgeting apps)

No remote collection occurs.

---

## **2. Data Sharing**
Pocket Flow does **not** share any data with third parties.  
No data is sold, rented, or transferred outside your device.

---

## **3. Data Usage**
Your data is used **solely within the App** for purposes such as:

- Displaying expense summaries  
- Storing, processing, importing, and exporting entries  
- Generating charts, insights, and analytics  

Pocket Flow does **not** use your data for advertising or tracking purposes.

---

## **4. Data Retention & Deletion**
All data remains stored locally on your device until you choose to delete it.

You may delete data in the following ways:

- Remove individual expense entries  
- Clear all app data from Android system settings  
- Delete imported files from your device storage  

No copies are stored by us.

---

## **5. File Imports & Exports**
If you choose to import data (e.g., Pocket Flow CSV backups), the App processes the file **on-device only**.

If you export your data, the App saves a file to your device.  
Pocket Flow does **not** upload exported files to any server.

---

## **6. Security**
Pocket Flow relies on Android's built-in sandboxing and secure storage mechanisms.  
The App does not transmit data over the internet unless you manually share an exported file.

---

## **7. Children’s Privacy**
Pocket Flow is not directed toward children under 13.  
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

---

## **8. Changes to This Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy as the App evolves.  
Any updates will appear on this page with a revised "Last updated" date.
