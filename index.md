Pocket Flow Privacy Policy

Last updated: December 2025

Pocket Flow is a personal budgeting and expense tracking application. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This policy explains how the app handles information.

1. Data Collection

Pocket Flow stores all expense data locally on your device.
The app does NOT collect, upload, or transmit your data to any server controlled by us or any third party.

The following data may be stored locally if you choose to enter it:

Expense amounts

Categories

Dates

Notes

Imported files (e.g., CSV backups from other apps)

2. Data Sharing

Pocket Flow does not share your data with any third parties.

3. Data Usage

Your data is used strictly within the app for:

Displaying expense summaries

Storing/importing/exporting entries

Generating charts and analytics

No usage analytics, tracking, or advertising identifiers are collected.

4. Data Retention & Deletion

All data remains on your device.
You may delete entries or clear all app data at any time through system settings.

5. File Imports & Exports

If you import data from a Pocket Flow export file, then Pocket Flow processes the file entirely on-device.

If you export data, it is saved to your device's storage only.

6. Security

Pocket Flow relies on Android's sandboxing and secure storage environment.
No network transmission occurs unless a user manually shares an exported file.

7. Changes

We may update this policy as features evolve. Updates will be posted here.
